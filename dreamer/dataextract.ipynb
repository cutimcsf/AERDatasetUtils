    "# About\n",
    "Use this notebook to extract ECG data from the DREAMER dataset. DREAMER has 22 participants watching 17 movie clips. This notebook will generate one CSV for each Person-MovieClip combo named like so:\n",
    "    person_#_clip_#.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The CSV will have 3 columns:\n",
    "    TIMESTAMP, CHANNEL1, CHANNEL2\n",
    "\n",
    "DREAMER does not provide a start time for each ECG, so the TIMESTAMP starts at 0 and represents the elapsed time from the start of the trial recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: This will generate 1.6GB of CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Setup\n",
    "Before using this notebook, you must use MATLAB to extract the DREAMER.Data structure from the dataset's DREAMER.mat file, and save it as a JSON file. To do that, use Matlab or Octave and do the following:\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "dreamer=load('DREAMER.mat')\n",
    "\n",
    "fid=fopen('DREAMER_Data.json')\n",
    "fprintf(fid, '%s', jsonencode(dreamer.Data)\n",
    "fclose(fid)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*NOTE:* if you try to encode the entire `dreamer` struct, you'll get a truncated JSON file due to some 2GB file limit ... I'm sure there's a way to work around that, but we only need the `dreamer.Data` value anyway, and it fits nicely within the limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, set PATH_TO_DREAMERDATA_JSON in the first cell to the path of your DREAMER_Data.json file."
